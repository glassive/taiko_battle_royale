# Taiko Battle Royale Repository

**Taiko Battle Royale** is a series of weekly osu!taiko tournaments in a battle royale format, hosted by [nevqr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14269506).

This repository is used to store data used by the Taiko Seeder bot, another tool that I've made.
You can find user-submitted qualifier replays, automatically generated seeding files in .csv, as well as a `placements.csv` file which tracks the total #1, #2 and #3 placements across all played maps for all players.
I will be making a frontend page with GitHub Pages, allowing anyone to easily see custom data related to the tournament.
